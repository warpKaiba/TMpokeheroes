# TMpokeheroes
## A collection of user-scripts for ease of use, cheating, and profit for Pokeheroes.

Pokeheroes is a Pokemon fan-game website where users can perform various activities such as breeding, catching, raising, and collecting Pokemon by interacting with the website. Known as a "Poke-Clicker", Pokeheroes is one of a handful of Pokemon fan-game with a similar play style.
The scripts in this repository can aid in making certain features of Pokeheroes easier. The scripts execute code in the user's browser to accomplish this.

## How to install

1.) You will need either the Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey or Scriptify browser extension, depending on your browser/preference. I've only tested these with [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) on Chrome. Tampermonkey is also available for [Firefox.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/). These scripts work on Firefox for Android using the Tampermonkey extension as well, but haven't been tested thoroughly.

2.) Click on the script you want in the list above, then click Raw. It should bring up a new tab asking if you would like to install it. !

※If using mobile, you need to download the script and open it using the extension.

3.) Scripts will automatically update per your extension settings.

# Script Info

## PHAutoBugContest.user.js
Affects the monthly bug contest minigame.

This gets rid of the time limit and will also automatically click on bug types. It's a bit slow, but you can help it along by clicking on bugs as well. The play area and spawn rate is increased, and the Pokemon do not despawn.

## PHAutoSlots.user.js
Affects the golden slot machines.

Removes the annoying delayed alert-box popup when you win a prize. Instead, the message appears above the slot machine immediately.

Will also automatically spin the slots indefinitely after you spin them for the first time. Press the back button on your browser or navigate to a different page to stop it.

## PHConcentrationCheater.user.js
Affects the concentration card flip game in the game center.

This script will make cards stay face up after you get an incorrect match.

## PHEasyFish.user.js
Affects the beach fishing game

Lets you catch fish very quickly until you run out of energy. Catches probably 4 fish a second.

## PHEpicScriptEPIC.user.js
Affects all clicklists.

This script will automatically "click" through a clicklist for as long as you have the tab open.
The default speed is 1000ms/1 second. You can change the speed through an input box that appears in a clicklist.

## PHRoyalTunnelCheat.user.js
Affects the royal tunnel

This automatically goes through the royal tunnel for you. Performs an ajax request to the site pokedex for each question to find the answers
You will have the option to take breaks every 100 levels, as well as set a delay for how long it takes to solve a question.
*Try not to get on the ranklist with this one. Turn off the script or answer a question incorrectly before you get to level 8000.

## PHShadowRadar.user.js
Affects the shadow radar

Just hit the auto-pilot button and watch it go. Finds a shadow pokemon within a minute. A little unpolished, but works.

## PH_partyselectall.user.js
Affects the storage box page.

This script simply adds a "Select All" button to the party, or the box currently selected.

## PHberries.user.js
Affects the berry garden and toolshed.

This script allows you to plant every vacant spot of land in the current garden with the currently selected seed, and water every plant simutaneously as well.
New: You can select which berry you want to plant through a convienient dropdown menu, as well as what level you want to plant. Also present for the seed-makers.

The script in action (old version without seed/level selection):

## PHcaptcha.user.js
Affects clicklists

This is just the part of the EPIC script which bypasses the "Are you a human?" check. Use this if you want to leave an auto-clicking program on for an extended period of time, for when you don't want to interact as quickly as EPIC does.

*Make sure you don't run PHcaptcha and EPIC at the same time!

## PHcoinflipper.user.js
Affects the coin flip game in the game center.

This script adds several buttons for flipping the coin 10, 100, and 1000 times, as well as an infinite flip button. There is also a stop button to make the flipping stop for any of these options.

## PHDaycare.user.js
Affects the daycare.

Automatically starts a scan on the first 3 pokemon it can as soon as you load the daycare page. Also adds a button to adopt all.

## PHhangman.user.js
Affects the hangman game in the game center.

This script will automatically solve hangman puzzles. The word bank is not complete, but can solve most of them.

## PHlottery.user.js
Affects the lottery card page.

Just adds a "buy 500 cards" button so you don't have to type it in every time.
